## Portfolio Workshop

### Part I

```
TODO

Make a workshop that looks like the following:

- Start by giving the html & css of the website that you made in part II
- The learner's job is to replace the content with their own information
- And then add their own flare to it by embedding
  - A Tweet Button
  - YouTube Video
  - Sound Cloud
  - Instagram
  - Pinterest Button
- Push to GitHub pages.
```

### Part II

Instead of filling in an existing HTML template, this tutorial walks through
creating everything from scratch.

**Notes:**

- This workshop has not been tested yet.
- I anticipate it running 1hr - 2 hours long (it's too long).

**Anticipated Issues:**

- People will be bored
